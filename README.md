# WPC (Whole-picture Workload Characterization)

## Overview
WPC (Whole-picture Workload Characterization) is an advanced analysis tool that quantifies how critical system components impact computational pipeline efficiency. The tool achieves this by comprehensive data collection and hierarchical analysis including three fundamental layers:

- Intermediate Representation (IR) Layer: Languages, programming frameworks, compilers
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Layer: Runtime environments, third-party libraries, OS
- Microarchitecture Layer: Hardware execution characteristics

Cross-Platform Support
Compatible with x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures across multiple operating systems
